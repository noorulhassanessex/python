This Python program performs grouped data analysis for continuous numerical values entered by the user. The user can input data, which is then stored in a CSV file for further processing. The program groups the data based on a user-specified class width and calculates key statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and modal class. It also displays a histogram to visualize the frequency distribution.

The interface is menu-driven, offering options to enter data, view calculated statistics, and generate a histogram. Grouped data and results are also saved in CSV format for review. This project demonstrates key programming skills such as file handling, modular programming, data processing using Pandas and NumPy, and visualization with Matplotlib. It is useful for students and learners who want to understand data distribution, grouping, and basic statistical analysis in Python.
